An E-card is an electronic postcard or greeting card, with the primary difference being that it is created using digital media instead of paper or other traditional materials. 
<br>E-cards are made available many different ways, usually on various Internet sites. 
<br>
<br>They can be sent to a recipient virtually, usually via e-mail or an instant messaging service.

Since e-cards are digital "content", they are highly editable, allowing them to be extensively personalised by the sender. 
<br>They are also capable of presenting animated gifs or video.
<br>Typically, an E-card sender chooses from an on-line catalog of E-cards made available on a publisher's web site.
<br>After selecting a card, the sender can personalize it to various degrees by adding a message, photo, or video.
<br> Finally, the sender specifies the recipient's e-mail address and the web site delivers an e-mail message to the recipient on behalf of the sender.
